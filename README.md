        scale = 1.0,
        coords = vector3(x, y, z)
    },
    testDriveSpawn = vector3(x, y, z), -- Spawn point for test drives
    cars = {
        {
            pos = vector3(x, y, z),
            heading = 0.0,
            model = 'adder',
            price = 1000000,
            label = "Truffade Adder",
            category = "Supersport"
        }
    }
}
```
